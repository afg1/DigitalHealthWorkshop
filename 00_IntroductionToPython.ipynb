    "### A note on string formatting\n",
    "String formatting is one way to get data out of python in a string that we can see on the screen. If you look at some of the cells we have been running, you will see things that look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(f\"some words then {a_variable} in curly braces\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a relatively new way of formatting strings in python, called an f-string. It will substitute the string representation of `a_variable` wherever it is in the string. This is my favourite method for formatting strings, but there are others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next most common is the string `.format` method, which works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"some words then {0} in curly braces\".format(a_variable)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This would print the exact same thing as the f-string example. The `.format` method is sometimes better when you want to print the same variable in multiple places in a string, and for me it is easier to see how to do formatting with this type. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"{0:.4f}\".format(333/106))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Should look fairly familiar...\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we tell python to format this as a floating point number and only show us 4 decimal places. Similarly\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(\"{0:04d}\".format(10))`\n",
    "\n",
    "Will print an integer (that's what the d means) with enough leading zeros to always have 4 digits. This is *very* useful when dealing with patient IDs for example.\n",
